HACKING

Here is how to develop on this code base.

Install SASS
============

Complete the steps in globally install SASS if you currently do not have it
installed:
http://sass-lang.com/install

Running SASS
============

Once you have SASS installed. Open terminal (CTRL+Alt+T) and cd into your
branch folder. Then enter this command to begin watching your scss files:
$ sass --watch 0.1/ambiance/css/sass/default.scss:0.1/ambiance/css/appTemplate.css --style expanded

Automated UI tests
==================

The ubuntu-html5 container and the ubuntu-ui-toolkit both use autopilot (https://launchpad.net/autopilot) to test its functional elements.

To run the tests, you will need to install python3-autopilot and libautopilot-qt.
Then do the following:

    $ cd tests/autopilot/
    $ autopilot3 run ubuntu_html5_ui_toolkit
    $ autopilot3 run ubuntu_html5_container

You can get a list of all available tests with the following commands:

    $ autopilot3 list ubuntu_html5_ui_toolkit
    $ autopilot3 list ubuntu_html5_container
