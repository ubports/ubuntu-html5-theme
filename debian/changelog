    add docslib.py, used by yuidoc-build.sh to obtain bzr branch rev and
    insert it into yuidoc.json for use during build * add
    DOCSREADMET.txt: critical info about building docs * yuidoc.json:
    add majorversion field and set it to current framework: html-14.04-
    dev. The bzr branch rev is appended to this to create useful version
    field, which is consumed by yuidoc build and inserted into built
    html. As a result, the built index.html states the framework and the
    branch bzr rev as follows: "API Docs for: HTML-14.04-dev~bzr155"

  * In order to allow the local CordovaUbuntu 3.4. plugin to be embedded
    locally in an HTML5 click package, the cordova-ubuntu-container bits
    are being copied over in arch specific paths, e.g.
    ./lib/<arch>/CordovaUbuntu.3.4. The function that was used before
    QQmlEngine::addPluginPath works only (from what I can see) when
    *from within* a qml plugin that defines a binary plugin, one wants
    to add a library search path which is not the situation we are in.
